        For the final project I am interested in making a twitter-like web app
        using HTMX. Users will be able to post tweets, and like and comment on
        others' posts, using dynamic updates. I chose HTMX because it enables a
        more efficient and seamless user experience and is an up-and-coming
        coding language that I would love to get some hands-on experience with.
        This project will highlight HTMX's capabilities of building interactive,
        real-time web apps that enhance performance and simplicity.{" "}
